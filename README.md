# CS 170 Project Spring 2021

Take a look at the project spec before you get started!

Requirements:

Python 3.6+

You'll only need to install networkx to work with the starter code. For installation instructions, follow: https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html

If using pip to download, run `python3 -m pip install networkx`


Files:
- `parse.py`: functions to read/write inputs and outputs
- `solver.py`: where you should be writing your code to solve inputs
- `utils.py`: contains functions to compute cost and validate NetworkX graphs

When writing inputs/outputs:
- Make sure you use the functions `write_input_file` and `write_output_file` provided
- Run the functions `read_input_file` and `read_output_file` to validate your files before submitting!
  - These are the functions run by the autograder to validate submissions

To reproduce our code, simply run `python solver.py`; there is a line in the MAIN that allows you to change size-change this var to "small", "medium" or "large" to get the correct output.
In terms of non standard libraries, we only used numpy and itertools for more efficient iteration/computation
